In Credit Score Model:-Develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data by the machine learning classification algorithms and assess the model's accuracy.
In Disease Prediction Model:-ðŸŒŸ In this mini project, I created a basic disease prediction model that uses symptoms as input to predict potential diseases by Classification. The model takes binary values for various symptoms and outputs the most likely disease based on the input. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model processes the symptom patterns to provide accurate predictions, offering a simple yet effective tool for symptom-based disease identification.Model Training with Decision Tree Classifier.
